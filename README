PaCaLib: my 2D rendering library based on Pango/Cairo
-----------------------------------------------------

This is an object-oriented library to draw graphics primitives including lines, circles, text, etc...

It is based on the following external libraries:
- cairo     www.cairographics.org   for rendering graphics primitives
- pango     www.pango.org           for rendering international text
